<h2>"Fully vaccinated" doesn't mean "immune to COVID-19"</h2>
        <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the country, people 
            who are fully vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. 
            But Dr. Carbona warns that now still isn't the time to let your guard down.
            While the vaccines are potent, there's still a chance that you could become
            infected.
            <br>
            <br>
            <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Carbona explains.   
            <br>
            <br>
            "'Fully vaccinated' means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as
            recommended for the best protection against severe complications such as
            hospitalization and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% protection against illness
            , yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences
            of being exposed to the SARS-Cov2 virus"
            <br>
            <br>
           </p>
           
<h3>
            Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to Others, 
            including other vaccinated people?
</h3>
<p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur
    at a lower rate. she adds that this could also be a reality for people who dont't have 
    a good immune response to vaccines.
    <br>
    <br>
    "The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying
    health disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the 
    COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the 
    vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations."
