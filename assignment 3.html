    <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>

   
    <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine
         different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.<br>
<br>

        At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights.
        When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes 
        of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen,
        I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and

    walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place.
    <br><br>
    It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became intrested in language. 
    <br><br>
    It began with french, which taught me the importance of prononciation. I remember once 
    asking a store owner in paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when i pronounced it
    PYR-a-mides instead of pry-A-mides, with more accent on the A, she looked as me bewildered.
    <br><br>
    In the eight grade, I became fascinated with spanish and aware of its similarities with english
    through cognates. Baseball in spanish for example, is beisbol, which looks different but
    sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made me speech and comprehension more 
    fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when i forget how to say 
    saomething in spanish.
    <br><br>
    Then in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for chinese. As I studied chinese at my
    school, i marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost.
    I love how long words were formed by combinning simpler characters, so Huo () meaning
    fire and shan() meaning mountain can be joined to create Houshan() which means volcano.
    I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and rhythms as I form them.
