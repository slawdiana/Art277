    We've heard it all since the pandemic started - lemon juice kill the coronavirus
    , masks don't work, if you already had <a href="#">COVID-19</a> you can't get it again
    or that the vaccines approved for emergency use will change your DNA or put a tracking
    device in your body.

        Wonderful news, right? Wonderful news, right?

        Well, not to some. vaccinated people are up against a new set of myth - they're literaly
        magnetic or they're going to shed vaccine components and after the DNA of Unvaccinated
        people. And despite the extra layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the
        same pandemic realities as everyone else.
        <br> <br>
         So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for
            them to spread COVID-19 to others? Infectious disease specialist <a href="#">Lysette Carbona</a>, 
                </u> MD, answers those questions and covers why vaccination is still one of our
                best weapons in the fight against COVID-19.
